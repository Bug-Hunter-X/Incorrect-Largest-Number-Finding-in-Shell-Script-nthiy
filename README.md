This repository contains a shell script that aims to find the largest number within a file named "numbers.txt". However, the script has a flaw: it does not handle non-numeric values or empty files correctly, leading to unexpected results.  The bug is demonstrated in "bug.sh". A corrected version, addressing the shortcomings and providing robust error handling, is available in "bugSolution.sh".  The script uses bash's arithmetic expansion (( )) for comparisons.
